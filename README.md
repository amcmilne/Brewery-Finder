# Brewery-Finder

## Description

The Brewery Finder application allows the user to search for information on breweries by city and state and filter the response by type (e.g. micro brewery, nano brewery, bar, etc.). The application will also automatically render results for the user's current location, if any are nearby. Additionally, if the user desires information for a specific brewery, they may make a search by name. The page will only display five results at most, but a user may paginate through the results using the next and previous buttons located at the bottom of the page.

For each displayed brewery, the name, address, phone number, and website of the brewery will be provided if available from the [database](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/). A random brewery-related image from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/api/) is appended to each rendered brewery section as well.
